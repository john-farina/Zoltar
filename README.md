<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For this project I used layers of images then animated, and oriented it with CSS. Using Javascript to add and remove animations as well. Created design with Images, and pure CSS.

<img src="./src/img/ZoltarFirst.gif" alt="a gif of Zoltar with hand moving and lamps flickering" />

I then manipulate the DOM to place a random fortune after Zoltar has spoken wisdom, which is randomized and played using [Howler](howler.link) The random fortunes come from an array and generates a unique set of lucky numbers for each fortune.

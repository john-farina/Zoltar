<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For this project I used layers of images then animated, and oriented it with CSS. Using Javascript to add and remove animations as well. Created design with Images, and pure CSS.

<img src="./src/img/ZoltarFirst.gif" alt="a gif of Zoltar with hand moving and lamps flickering" />

I then manipulate the DOM to place a random fortune after Zoltar has spoken wisdom, which is randomized and played using [Howler](howler.link) The random fortunes come from an array and generates a unique set of lucky numbers for each fortune.

## Built With
 - Javascript
 - CSS

## Design

### Zoltar

For making Zoltar i wanted to use all CSS, but allowed myself to use a image for the main Image.
<br/>
I cut the Zoltar image into 3 layers. (the body, and both hands).
<br/>


<img src="./src/img/hand.png" width="35" />
<img src="./src/img/fullPic.png" width="100" />
<img src="./src/img/depthPic.png" width="100" />

<br/>
I cut them this way so i can animate his right hand with css, and place his other hand over a css made table to create depth.

<br/>

### Booth & Background

For the booth design first i made the Zoltar logo which old fortune telling machines usually have, i used a JS library for the curve of the text and added a `text-shadow` to create more depth.

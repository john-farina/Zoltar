(()=>{"use strict";const e=["You've been wondering what to do\n  with all those benefits you have or\n  are about to receive. Just remember\n  the branches of a tree return their sap\n  to the root from where it comes, as\n  a river pours its streams to the sea,\n  where its spring was supplied. The\n  heart of the grateful man is delighted\n  to return a benefit received. You are\n  basically a kind and good person. You\n  find confidence in the goodness of\n  another. This is good proof of one's\n  own goodness. Your heart may be\n  pleased to know that there is many\n  a good man to be found under a\n  shabby hat.","If you subdue yourself and return to\n   the practice of what is right, if one\n   day you achieve self-control and\n   return to what is right, the world will\n   acknowledge you as a person at his\n   best. Being the best must come from\n   you yourself. One cannot acquire it\n   from others. Look at nothing which\n   is contrary to what is right, listen to\n   nothing contrary to what is right,\n   speak nothing contrary to what is\n   right, and do nothing contrary to\n   what is right. You will then be a per-\n   son at his best.","Romance or great friendship you'll\n    soon find adds great pleasure to your\n    life. You may find that it is difficult\n    to know at what moment this love\n    begins, but less difficult to know that\n    it has begun. Your love is eternal-\n    the aspect may change, but not the\n    essence. There is the same difference\n    in you before and after you are in\n    love as there is in an unlighted lamp\n    and one that is burning, The lamp\n    was there and was a good lamp, but\n    now it is shedding light too, and that\n    is its real function. As the greatest\n    pleasure of life is love. Remember\n    when this love comes or if it has\n    already arrived, the heart is wiser\n    than the intellect.","Yes, you've been up against it at\n    times, and fate has been at the bot-\n    tom of it all. Now you can look ahead\n    to better times. You will dream about\n    sun and that will be the beginning of\n    a bright future. You are a very sincere\n    individual and like to be surrounded\n    by your good friends. Your money\n    troubles will soon disappear and you\n    will be able to indulge in a few luxu-\n    ries that you've been craving. You will\n    be besieged by those less fortunate\n    for monetary help and no one will\n    go unaided.","Recently you've had to make some\n    judgements as others may be judg-\n    ing you. A wise man makes his own\n    decisions, an ignorant man follows\n    the public opinion. A mountain is\n    composed of tiny grains of earth.\n    The ocean is made up of tiny drops\n    of water. Even so, life is but an end-\n    less series of little details, actions,\n    speeches, and thoughts, and the\n    consequences whether good or bad\n    of even the least of them are so far\n    reaching. The more we judge, the less\n    we love. Patience and thought will\n    show you the right way.","A ship in the harbor is safe, but that\n    is not what ships are built for. Take\n    risks and venture out of your com-\n    fort zone. If you don't move beyond\n    where you are today, you will never\n    have more or be more. There is a trip\n    that you have been thinking of tak-\n    ing. Go. You will make some valuable\n    new contacts.","Standard setting directives you set\n    must be followed but the important\n    thing is self-reformation. The words\n    of appointment for accomplishment\n    are pleasing but the important thing\n    is self-reflection. There is nothing\n    you can do to gain complete\n    satisfaction without self-reflection.\n    Nor can there be compliance without\n    self-reformation.\n    Put loyalty and reliability first. \n    If you have faults do not fear self-improvement.","You may be riding the winds of\n    change. Things may at times seem\n    to be out of touch. Soon they will\n    come down to a better order. As the\n    blessings of health and fortune have\n    a beginning, so they must also find\n    an end. Everything rises but to fall.\n    To make sense of all this, you will\n    find the answer is to be found in how\n    well you relate to people. Looking at\n    the big picture will help shape your\n    long-range plans. If things are not\n    always smooth, remember that he\n    who could foresee affairs but three\n    days in advance would be rich for\n    thousands of years.","Now is the time to start that new\n    project you have been contemplating.\n    Your deliberation will pay off in the\n    long run because doubt is the father\n    of invention and the key to knowl-\n    edge. This newfound industry pays\n    debts, while if you despair, you will\n    only increase them. The time is right\n    to get going. If you are to move the\n    world, first you must move yourself.\n    'If you find yourself working too hard\n    to achieve your goal, you may find\n    basic truth. The great person with\n    vigor would demand the rightness\n    of things, timeliness of action, and\n    propriety of method. In this way,\n    power does not become sheer force.\n    You will be surprised at what you\n    will accomplish.","You've been wondering if you have\n    spent your time wisely. A man that is\n    young in years may be old in hours\n    if he has lost no time. If you feel old\n    then you know you have not wasted\n    any time. If you feel young then do\n    not waste the day before you now.\n    Remember a day is a fortune and an\n    estate; if you lose a day you lose life\n    itself. Do not worry about the time;\n    experience each new day. A wave\n    which has passed cannot be called\n    back, nor can an hour which has gone\n    be returned. Your time will come\n    by and by; there are great things in\n    store for you. Swift, speedy time will\n    bring new and interesting things this\n    month, feathered with flying hours.\n    Be careful over the years not to let it\n    dissolve the beauty of thy brow.","You emerge from your recent fog\n    and get down to business. Life\n    becomes more serious and realistic. If\n    a person takes no thought about what\n    is distant he will find sorrow near at\n    hand. There is a need for good busi-\n    ness judgement now. When things are\n    going well it is all too easy to become\n    over confident and not give proper\n    attention to one's duties. If this ten-\n    dency is recognized early it may be\n    corrected and no harm will be done.\n    You will also find time after business\n    is settled for friends and/or lovers.\n    It is easy to see, hard to foresee.",'Ah, you have been granted the card\n    of the elephant. The great ancients\n    have said that the elephant is a sym-\n    bol of strength, stability, power, and\n    wisdom. This is not to say that such\n    things are only received by a medium\n    as grand as an elephant. This month,\n    wisdom will be delivered to you by\n    the unexpected. Seek wisdom wher-\n    ever you go and remember that "he\n    who does not know one thing, knows\n    another."\n    ',"You've had to balance your time\n    recently between work and friends.\n    Your work consists of whatever you\n    are obliged to do and your play\n    consists of whatever you are not\n    obligated to do. Just remember better\n    is a person of humble standing who\n    works for himself than one who plays\n    the great person but lacks food on\n    the table. This is a delicate balance\n    indeed. For if you do not get it right\n    you will be likened to a tree whose\n    branches are numerous but whose\n    roots are few. The winds come along\n    and uproots it and sweeps it down.\n    You will soon master this balance.\n    Work and love these are the very\n    basics of life to master indeed.","I see a great deal of happiness in\n    store for you. Thousands of candles\n    can be lighted from a single candle\n    and the life of the candle will not be\n    shortened. Happiness never decreases\n    by being shared. So, if an object you\n    ardently pursue brings little happi-\n    ness when gained, remember most of\n    our pleasures come from unexpected\n    sources. Share the good news when\n    it arrives. For happiness is like a sun-\n    beam which the least shadow shall\n    intercept, while suffering is often as\n    the rain of spring. Enjoy this very day.","When you pull a card and draw a heart\n    You and your beloved will never part.\n    You are a strong believer in fate. You\n    feel that you have no control over\n    your destiny. Fortunately you\n    are destined to be very happy indeed.\n    You've had some trouble mostly\n    caused by inconsideration of others.\n    But fate will be kind to you and\n    you can expect your life to run on a\n    smoother pattern. You are somewhat\n    irresponsible and that has caused you\n    some hardships. You have a neat and\n    tidy nature and can't tolerate sloven-\n    liness around you. Since you demand\n    this of yourself and others, you will\n    always live in a tidy atmosphere."];let n,t;const o=document.querySelector("body");function a(e){return Math.floor(Math.random()*e)}function i(){let e=a(100);return 0===e&&(e="08"),1===e&&(e="01"),2===e&&(e="02"),3===e&&(e="03"),4===e&&(e="04"),5===e&&(e="05"),6===e&&(e="06"),7===e&&(e="07"),8===e&&(e="08"),9===e&&(e="09"),e=e.toString(),e}function s(){const s=document.createElement("div");s.classList.add("fortuneTicket");const r=document.createElement("h2");r.classList.add("fortuneHeader"),r.classList.add("header"),r.innerHTML="YOUR FORTUNE";const h=document.createElement("div");h.classList.add("lineBreak"),h.classList.add("lineOne");const l=document.createElement("div");var d;l.classList.add("text-container"),n=document.createElement("p"),d=function(){let n=a(e.length);return e[n]}(),n.innerHTML=d,l.appendChild(n);const u=document.createElement("h2");u.classList.add("fortuneHeader"),u.classList.add("bottom"),u.innerHTML="PLAY AGAIN!";const f=document.createElement("div");f.classList.add("lineBreak"),f.classList.add("lineTwo"),t=document.createElement("p"),function(){let e=function(){let e=[];for(let n=0;n<6;n++)e[n]=i();return`Your Lucky Numbers: ${function(e){let n="";for(let t=0;t<e.length;t++){let o=e[t].toString();n+=5===t?`${o}. `:`${o}, `}return n}(e)}`}();t.innerHTML=e}(),s.appendChild(r),s.appendChild(h),s.appendChild(l),s.appendChild(u),s.appendChild(f),s.appendChild(t),o.appendChild(s)}s(),document.querySelector(".testButton").addEventListener("click",(function(){s()}))})();

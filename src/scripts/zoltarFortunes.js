    `You've been wondering what to do
  with all those benefits you have or
  are about to receive. Just remember
  the branches of a tree return their sap
  to the root from where it comes, as
  a river pours its streams to the sea,
  where its spring was supplied. The
  heart of the grateful man is delighted
  to return a benefit received. You are
  basically a kind and good person. You
  find confidence in the goodness of
  another. This is good proof of one's
  own goodness. Your heart may be
  pleased to know that there is many
  a good man to be found under a
  shabby hat.`,

    `If you subdue yourself and return to
   the practice of what is right, if one
   day you achieve self-control and
   return to what is right, the world will
   acknowledge you as a person at his
   best. Being the best must come from
   you yourself. One cannot acquire it
   from others. Look at nothing which
   is contrary to what is right, listen to
   nothing contrary to what is right,
   speak nothing contrary to what is
   right, and do nothing contrary to
   what is right. You will then be a person 
   at his best.`,

    `Romance or great friendship you'll
    soon find adds great pleasure to your
    life. You may find that it is difficult
    to know at what moment this love
    begins, but less difficult to know that
    it has begun. Your love is eternal
    the aspect may change, but not the
    essence. There is the same difference
    in you before and after you are in
    love as there is in an unlighted lamp
    and one that is burning, The lamp
    was there and was a good lamp, but
    now it is shedding light too, and that
    is its real function. As the greatest
    pleasure of life is love. Remember
    when this love comes or if it has
    already arrived, the heart is wiser
    than the intellect.`,

    `Yes, you've been up against it at
    times, and fate has been at the bottom 
    of it all. Now you can look ahead
    to better times. You will dream about
    sun and that will be the beginning of
    a bright future. You are a very sincere
    individual and like to be surrounded
    by your good friends. Your money
    troubles will soon disappear and you
    will be able to indulge in a few luxuries 
    that you've been craving. You will
    be besieged by those less fortunate
    for monetary help and no one will
    go unaided.`,

    `Recently you've had to make some
    judgements as others may be judging 
    you. A wise man makes his own
    decisions, an ignorant man follows
    the public opinion. A mountain is
    composed of tiny grains of earth.
    The ocean is made up of tiny drops
    of water. Even so, life is but an endless 
    series of little details, actions,
    speeches, and thoughts, and the
    consequences whether good or bad
    of even the least of them are so far
    reaching. The more we judge, the less
    we love. Patience and thought will
    show you the right way.`,

    `A ship in the harbor is safe, but that
    is not what ships are built for. Take
    risks and venture out of your comfort 
    zone. If you don't move beyond
    where you are today, you will never
    have more or be more. There is a trip
    that you have been thinking of taking. 
    Go. You will make some valuable
    new contacts.`,

    `Standard setting directives you set
    must be followed but the important
    thing is self-reformation. The words
    of appointment for accomplishment
    are pleasing but the important thing
    is self-reflection. There is nothing
    you can do to gain complete
    satisfaction without self-reflection.
    Nor can there be compliance without
    self-reformation.
    Put loyalty and reliability first. 
    If you have faults do not fear self-improvement.`,

    `You may be riding the winds of
    change. Things may at times seem
    to be out of touch. Soon they will
    come down to a better order. As the
    blessings of health and fortune have
    a beginning, so they must also find
    an end. Everything rises but to fall.
    To make sense of all this, you will
    find the answer is to be found in how
    well you relate to people. Looking at
    the big picture will help shape your
    long-range plans. If things are not
    always smooth, remember that he
    who could foresee affairs but three
    days in advance would be rich for
    thousands of years.`,

    `Now is the time to start that new
    project you have been contemplating.
    Your deliberation will pay off in the
    long run because doubt is the father
    of invention and the key to knowledge. 
    This newfound industry pays
    debts, while if you despair, you will
    only increase them. The time is right
    to get going. If you are to move the
    world, first you must move yourself.
    'If you find yourself working too hard
    to achieve your goal, you may find
    basic truth. The great person with
    vigor would demand the rightness
    of things, timeliness of action, and
    propriety of method. In this way,
    power does not become sheer force.
    You will be surprised at what you
    will accomplish.`,

    `You've been wondering if you have
    spent your time wisely. A man that is
    young in years may be old in hours
    if he has lost no time. If you feel old
    then you know you have not wasted
    any time. If you feel young then do
    not waste the day before you now.
    Remember a day is a fortune and an
    estate; if you lose a day you lose life
    itself. Do not worry about the time;
    experience each new day. A wave
    which has passed cannot be called
    back, nor can an hour which has gone
    be returned. Your time will come
    by and by; there are great things in
    store for you. Swift, speedy time will
    bring new and interesting things this
    month, feathered with flying hours.
    Be careful over the years not to let it
    dissolve the beauty of thy brow.`,

    `You emerge from your recent fog
    and get down to business. Life
    becomes more serious and realistic. If
    a person takes no thought about what
    is distant he will find sorrow near at
    hand. There is a need for good business 
    judgement now. When things are
    going well it is all too easy to become
    over confident and not give proper
    attention to one's duties. If this tendency 
    is recognized early it may be
    corrected and no harm will be done.
    You will also find time after business
    is settled for friends and/or lovers.
    It is easy to see, hard to foresee.`,

    `Ah, you have been granted the card
    of the elephant. The great ancients
    have said that the elephant is a symbol 
    of strength, stability, power, and
    wisdom. This is not to say that such
    things are only received by a medium
    as grand as an elephant. This month,
    wisdom will be delivered to you by
    the unexpected. Seek wisdom wherever 
    you go and remember that "he
    who does not know one thing, knows
    another."
    `,

    `You've had to balance your time
    recently between work and friends.
    Your work consists of whatever you
    are obliged to do and your play
    consists of whatever you are not
    obligated to do. Just remember better
    is a person of humble standing who
    works for himself than one who plays
    the great person but lacks food on
    the table. This is a delicate balance
    indeed. For if you do not get it right
    you will be likened to a tree whose
    branches are numerous but whose
    roots are few. The winds come along
    and uproots it and sweeps it down.
    You will soon master this balance.
    Work and love these are the very
    basics of life to master indeed.`,

    `I see a great deal of happiness in
    store for you. Thousands of candles
    can be lighted from a single candle
    and the life of the candle will not be
    shortened. Happiness never decreases
    by being shared. So, if an object you
    ardently pursue brings little happiness 
    when gained, remember most of
    our pleasures come from unexpected
    sources. Share the good news when
    it arrives. For happiness is like a sunbeam 
    which the least shadow shall
    intercept, while suffering is often as
    the rain of spring. Enjoy this very day.`,

    `When you pull a card and draw a heart
    You and your beloved will never part.
    You are a strong believer in fate. You
    feel that you have no control over
    your destiny. Fortunately you
    are destined to be very happy indeed.
    You've had some trouble mostly
    caused by inconsideration of others.
    But fate will be kind to you and
    you can expect your life to run on a
    smoother pattern. You are somewhat
    irresponsible and that has caused you
    some hardships. You have a neat and
    tidy nature and can't tolerate slovenliness 
    around you. Since you demand
    this of yourself and others, you will
    always live in a tidy atmosphere.`,

    `Yes, you've been up against it at times,
and fate has been at the bottom of it all.
Now you can look ahead to better times.
You Will dream about sun and that will be
the beginning of a bright future.
You are a very sincere individual, and like
to be surrounded by your good friends.
Your money troubles will soon disappear
and you will be able to indulge in a few
luxurles that you've been craving. You will
be besleged by those less fortunate for
monetary help and no one will go unaided.`,

    `You've been trying to figure out the
best time to travel, You're wondering
if a business trip or a vacation would
be good. You may be wondering if to
travel is a better thing than to arrive. It
is not fit that everyone should travel.
You change your sky, not your mind,
when you cross the sea or land.
A busy idleness possesses you; you
seek a happy life, with ships, cars, and
planes: the object of your search is
present within you. If you travel for
your holiday remember a good holiday
is one spent among people whose
notions of time are more vague than
your own.`,

    `Unexpected wealth will arrive.
Remember he is richest, who is content
with the least, for content is the wealth of
nature. Although you may look for riches,
realize that wealth consists not in having
great possessions, but in having few wants.
When riches come, do not forget that man's
true wealth is the good he does in the world.
So, when opportunity knocks, grab it. It is
easy at any moment to resign the
possession of great fortune, to acquire It is
diffIcult and arduous.`,

    `What a joy to look ahead to read into the
signs of your future. So much happiness
is in store for you that the most brilliantly
lighted stars will be put to shame by the
brightness of your lle.
Ah, this is not all caused by sheer good
luck. Nay, nay my friend, your perseverance,
your clever ways of handling your domestic
problems and your sincerity in dealing with
others are pointing the way to their reward.
Oh happiness what an elusive thing you
are. But thank God you were born beneath
Its star.`,
